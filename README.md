# Covid_Library_Database
This is a database that uses Apache Derby Client along with JDBC to create a program that perfroms multiple queries. The database is designed to help libraries check out books safely to students. Students can pick up books from designated locations and this makes the checkout process covid-friendly and safe. The schema includes four tables: checkout, book, student and department. Each table has a primary key and some tables include reference keys as well. Examples of some queries include listing all the books in the library, selecting a book to checkout, displaying checkout list, adding a book to the library, displaying books of a specific department, displaying books issued by a specific student, and deleting a checkout entry etc
